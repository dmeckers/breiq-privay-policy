            compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the
            Application not functioning correctly or at all.

          <p>
            If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware
            that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply.
            Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data
            usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party
            charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such
            charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside
            of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data
            roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are
            using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from
            the bill payer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for
            your usage of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility to
            ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of
            battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider
            cannot be held responsible.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the
            application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure that
            it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to
            provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The
            Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
            that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality
            of the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The
            application is currently available as per the requirements for the
            operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the
            availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to
            download the updates if you want to continue using the application. The
            Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the
            application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the
            particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you
            agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The
            Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application and may
            terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you.
            Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
            licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using
            the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.
